# OCR_V1

This is a Optical Character Recognition program that uses Machine Learning in order to recognize handwritten digits. The model was trained on the MNIST dataset and achieved average accuracy results upon testing. I decided to switch to using Java, which yielded better results after training on the same MNIST dataset.
